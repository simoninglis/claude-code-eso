# Update Documentation: Reflect and Document Findings

## Overview
Analyse the recent work session and update appropriate project documentation with discoveries, new information, and insights.

## Analysis Scope
Review the session for:
1. **New Information**: APIs, configurations, or system behaviours discovered
2. **Process Improvements**: Workflows or procedures that proved effective
3. **Technical Insights**: Architecture understanding, integration patterns, or design decisions
4. **Troubleshooting Knowledge**: Issues encountered and their solutions
5. **Best Practices**: Approaches that worked well and should be documented

## Documentation Targets
Consider updating these documentation areas:
- **README.md**: Project overview, setup instructions, usage patterns
- **docs/ directory**: Architecture, operations, troubleshooting guides
- **API documentation**: New endpoints, parameters, or behaviours discovered
- **Configuration guides**: Settings, environment variables, deployment notes
- **Troubleshooting guides**: Common issues and solutions
- **Development guides**: Local setup, testing procedures, contribution guidelines

## Documentation Approach
For each finding:
1. Identify the most appropriate documentation location
2. Check if the information already exists and needs updating
3. Determine the right level of detail for the audience
4. Ensure information is actionable and well-structured
5. Cross-reference related documentation
6. Focus on information that helps team members be more effective

## Content Strategy
- **User-focused**: Write for people who need to use or maintain the system
- **Discoverable**: Place information where team members would logically look for it
- **Maintainable**: Keep documentation close to the code it describes when possible
- **Comprehensive**: Cover both happy path and edge cases
- **Current**: Ensure information reflects the actual system state
